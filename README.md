# RL-ChatMate

******* üöß‚ö†Ô∏è PROJECT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION ‚ö†Ô∏èüöß *********


RL ChatMate is an open-source project aimed at improving chatbot interactions using state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques. By fine-tuning language models with human feedback, the main goal is to enhance response quality, coherence, and engagement.

For this project I will be using the **CommonsenseQA dataset**.

CommonsenseQA is a new multiple-choice question answering dataset that requires different types of commonsense knowledge to predict the correct answers . It contains 12,102 questions with one correct answer and four distractor answers.  The dataset is provided in two major training/validation/testing set splits: "Random split" which is the main evaluation split, and "Question token split", see paper for details.
