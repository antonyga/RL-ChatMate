For this project I will be using the **CommonsenseQA dataset**.

CommonsenseQA is a new multiple-choice question answering dataset that requires different types of commonsense knowledge to predict the correct answers . It contains 12,102 questions with one correct answer and four distractor answers.  The dataset is provided in two major training/validation/testing set splits: "Random split" which is the main evaluation split, and "Question token split", see paper for details.
